ðŸŸ¥ will break if you don't use English or Italian language on discord 
-# thank you, discord developers, for making it annoying to work with ^3^
## enchanted ui
this one make the ui a little less cluttered and sleek

### known issues:
the server list could have problems on chrorium browsers

### why there are fetures that mayb brek if i don't use English or Italian?

this problem is due of discord developer using same classes and IDs for elements, and the only way to distinguish them is by using "aria-label" an element that is useful for blind people but we use it for distringuish an element from another if they have the same class and id, since aria-labels change for every language i decided to use englis, the most used lnguage and Italian, my native language;
if you want other launguages fork the repo, add it and then make a pull request so we can add the new languages, thanks
